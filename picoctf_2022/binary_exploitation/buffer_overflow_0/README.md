The program is available [here](https://github.com/03npan/ctf-write-ups/blob/main/picoctf_2022/binary_exploitation/buffer_overflow_0/vuln). You can view source [here](https://github.com/03npan/ctf-write-ups/blob/main/picoctf_2022/binary_exploitation/buffer_overflow_0/vuln.c). And connect with it using:

## Summary

Overflow the buffer to get program to print the flag.

## Detailed Solution

Looking at the source code, we see the flag is printed by the function `sigsegv_handler`, which will catch a segmentation fault. We can cause a seg fault by overflowing one of the buffers in the code, specifically `char buf2[16]` in the `vuln` function. This relies on the `gets` function in `main`, which will store characters past the end of the buffer.

Connect to the program using the provided command. Since the buffer we are trying to overflow holds 16 characters, we need to input more than 16 characters (it turns out 20 is the minimum needed to cause a segmentation fault).
