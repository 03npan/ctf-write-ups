## Summary

Take advantage of the `strstr` function used to determine if you win.

## Detailed Solution

In the source file, we see that we need to win 5 times to get the flag. How does the program determine if we win?

`if (strstr(player_turn, loses[computer_turn]))`

The program checks if the computer's selection loses to our selection by checking if the losing selection is a substring of our selection. We can take advantage of this and give all three options as our input: `rock/paper/scissors`

Do this five times and we get the flag: `picoCTF{50M3_3X7R3M3_1UCK_58F0F41B}`
