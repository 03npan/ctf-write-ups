## Summary

Use relative paths to get the website to show the contents of flag.txt.

## Detailed Solution

This appears to be a listing of a directory's contents. Typing in one of the file names shown causes the website to print out the contents of that file. Since the description says that absolute file paths are being filtered, let's try using relative paths to back up to the root directory and get the flag.

`../../../../flag.txt`

Note that we could use more than just 4 `../` for this web server - it will still put us in the root directory and allow us to read `flag.txt`.
