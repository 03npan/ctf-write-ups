## Summary

Use inspect element to find the credentials needed to get the flag.

## Detailed Solution

Try to log in. It will fail, so open inspect element on the "Log In Failed" page to see if the credentials are checked locally (hinted at by the challenge name). We see a script in the HTML that is checking our credentials. One line is of particular interest: `loggedIn = checkPassword(window.username, window.password);`

If we find the code for this function, we may be able to figure out the credentials. Since it's not contained in this page's code, maybe it's in a different file. Switching to the "Sources" tab, we find what we are looking for in the `secure.js` file.

`if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )`

Using those as the login credentials, we get the flag: `picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_05df90c8}`
