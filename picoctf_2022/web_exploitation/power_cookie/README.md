## Summary

Use inspect element to modify the cookie and get the flag.

## Detailed Solution

Clicking `Continue as guest` gives us a fail page. Using inspect element, we see that the button calls `continueAsGuest();`, and that a script is included with source `guest.js`. Switching to the "Sources" tab, we see the function called is in this file.

One line in the function is `document.cookie = "isAdmin=0";`. Let's change the cookie value to `isAdmin=1`.

Save the file, click the button, and we get the flag: `picoCTF{gr4d3_A_c00k13_5d2505be}`
